    // regard to initiative in combat, ranged attack rolls, Armor Class, Reflex saves, and

    // the Concentration skill, and fatigue-based general checks. Constitution also determines

    // spontaneous arcane spellcasters (like sorcerers and bards) can cast per day, and the effectiveness
    // of said spells. It also affects Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Gather Information, Handle Animal,
    // Intimidate, Perform, and Use Magic Device checks, how often and how effectively clerics and
    // paladins can turn undead, the wild empathy of druids and rangers, and a paladin's lay on hands ability.
